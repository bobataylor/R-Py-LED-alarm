# R-Py-LED-alarm
Waking up in the morning is hard. Especially when it's still dark outside.
This project is a simple python alarm clock designed to gently fade in an LED strip.

#Issues
- Some flickering is seen in the LED strip. It is believed to be a hardware issue, but has yet to be confirmed either way.

#TO-DO
- Integrate with Google Assistant
- Better LED color managment
